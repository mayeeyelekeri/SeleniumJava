- How to run this image
The Hub and Nodes will be created in the same network and they will recognize each other by their container name. A Docker network⁠ needs to be created as a first step.

- Create a Docker Network
docker network create grid

- Start the Hub using the created network
docker run -d -p 4442-4444:4442-4444 --net grid --name selenium-hub selenium/hub:latest

- Start the Node using the created network
docker run -d --net grid -e SE_EVENT_BUS_HOST=selenium-hub \
    --shm-size="2g" \
    -e SE_EVENT_BUS_PUBLISH_PORT=4442 \
    -e SE_EVENT_BUS_SUBSCRIBE_PORT=4443 \
    selenium/node-chrome:latest


Point your WebDriver tests to http://localhost:4444⁠
